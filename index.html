					<h1>Personal Data in Galleries PhD Project</h1>
					<p> Hello there! My name is Harriet Cameron, and this site describes some of the research I am undertaking as part of my PhD. 
						The PhD aims to create an ethical, transparent, and reciprocal method for art galleries to collect personal data. </p>
					<p>On here you will find information about what I've been doing, as well as links to resources if you're interested in learning 
						more about personal data privacy, exploitation, and potential futures. <b> 
						Feel free to contact me with questions, comments, queries, or feedback by emailing me at 
					<a href="mailto:harriet.cameron@nottingham.ac.uk?subject=PhD_Query"> harriet.cameron@nottingham.ac.uk </a></p>

						<h2>What is personal data?</h2>
						<p>Personal data is defined by the European Commission as "…any information that relates to an identified or
							identifiable living individual." This also includes "different pieces of information, which collected 
							together can lead to the identification of a particular person". This means that the term 'personal data'
							even includes information that might seem anonymised on its own, for example age, occupation, gender,
							sexuality, health status, hair colour... Even things like your fingerprints.<br />

										<h3>Personal Data</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Personal data is collected about us every single day, from dozens of different
									sources. Your social media accounts, the news sites you read, the public wifi you 
									connect to, CCTV cameras you pass, so on and so on. This data can be used for 
									good, or for bad, depending on who is collecting and why. </p>

										<h3>Power</h3>
									</header>
									<p>That personal data has power, but art galleries have power too, and so do you!
									Sometimes, data is used in ways that are hidden or deceptive, preventing the power 
									from being shared equally. By shedding light on these practices, it becomes possible to 
									redistribute power to make sure you have control over what happens to your data.</p>

										<h3>Why Art Galleries?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Art galleries are uniquely situated at the forefront of culture to share information
									to a huge number of people. They are able to disseminate and spread information about 
									your rights as data subjects, and to encourage healthier and more beneficial practices 
									surrounding the use of your personal data.</p>

						<h2>I want to make sure that you have the power over your own data to make informed decisions and protect yourselves</h2>
						<p> Data exploitation is an increasingly problematic source of concern and affects each and every one of us. From how much
						your mortgage costs, to the adverts you see, the recommendations suggested to you; each of these things can positively 
						affect your lives, but they can also be dangerous - particularly if you are part of a marginalised community.</p>

								<h3>How to get involved in the project</h3>
								<p>If you have visited an art gallery in the last 18 months, and are 18 years 
								old or more, then I want to hear from you! You don't need any existing knowledge
								about personal data or anything	of the sort; I'll make sure you know everything 
								that you need to know throughout the course of the online activities.</p>
								
								<p> Taking part will include watching a total of six short videos where I talk a 
								little bit about what personal data is, how it relates to power, what the project 
								hopes to achieve, and also where I set you some activities to complete online - 
								more on that in a second. Before taking part I will ask you to complete some 
								paperwork, including reading a short information sheet, and filling in a consent
									form to say you're happy to take part.</p>
								
								<p>The first two short videos will set the scene, and then the remaining four will </p>
							
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<p> each set you one activity to complete as soon as you are 
								able to. If you decide to take part, please do complete all of the actitivies, although
								you are welcome	to fit them in around your other commitments and take your time in doing
								so. In total, participation should take around 40-45 minutes. </p>
								
								<p> The first activity will ask you to fill in an individual worksheet that only you 
								and I will see using a website	called mural.co - their privacy policy can be found <a href="https://www.mural.co/terms/privacy-policy" target="_blank">here.</a> 
								Then, the next three activities will ask you to complete collaborative documents using
								the same website - these won't involve any personal data, just questions like <i> what
								kinds of data would you be willing to donate to galleries?</i> These documents will be
								filled in by all the participants, so you'll be able to see what other people are thinking
								and decide if you agree or not! </p> 
								<p> Before you make any decision about being involved, there is some paperwork I recommend
								reading. <a href="pdf/Information Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see
									the official information sheet.</a> This info sheet </p>
								
								
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<p> includes more information about 
								how your data will be used and your rights to withdraw from the study should you wish. </p>
								
								<p> <a href="pdf/Privacy Notice.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see the University of Nottingham's privacy notice</a> which explains in 
								depth how your data is processed, stored, shared, and protected within the University, as well 
								as laying out your rights under GDPR.</p>
								
								<p>Finally, before we begin, you will need to complete and return to me a <a href="pdf/ConsentForm.pdf" target="_blank">consent form</a>. I will send you an editable
								 copy of this form via email once you've been in touch. If you have any questions about 
								the form, do just send me an email and I'll be more than happy to talk you through it and
								what it all means (preferably before ticking no!)</p>

						<p>So hopefully by now you've decided if you want to be involved in the project. If the answer is (fingers crossed) yes,
						then it's time to get in touch! You can contact me at harriet.cameron@nottingham.ac.uk, or scroll down to the bottom of this 
						site to find a link which will take you to my email.</p>

									<h3>The Activities</h3>
									<p>By now, you should have read the information sheet and privacy notice, and 
									signed and returned to me a consent form. So it's time to get into the fun stuff!
									To the right of this text, you'll see six images. Each of these images will link
									you to a YouTube video which you will need to watch in order. Videos #1 and #2
									you can watch on their own, but the other four videos all require using one of the Mural 
									documents that I sent you links to by email. 
									<br> #3 relates to Activity A - Silhouettes;
									<br> #4 relates to Activity B - Identifying Data;
									<br> #5 relates to Activity C - Value of Data; 
									<br> #6 relates to Activity D - Reciprocation.</p>
									<p> Thank you again for agreeing to take part in this study - I hope you enjoy taking part 
									and hopefully something truly good will come from your time and dedication today.
									As always, I am available through email if you have any question, comments, or follow up.
									Thank you! - Harriet

						<h2>About me and contact info</h2>
						
						<img class="img-circular" src="images/HRC 750.jpg" />
						<p>I am an interdisciplinary PhD researcher at the Mixed Reality Lab, University of Nottingham, based in the Horizon CDT. 
						<br>I come from a background in Human Geography, where I studied digital identity, virtual communities, and online activism.
						<br>This fundamentally shaped my approach to research, which continues to explore identity, space, place, and how 
						<br>technologies interact with and configure these experiential concepts. Currently, my research centres around using 
						<br>technologies to enable more meaningful relationships to flourish between art, audiences, and cultural venues.</p>
