					<h1>Personal Data in Galleries PhD Project</h1>
					<p>Hello there! My name is Harriet Cameron and I'm a PhD student in the Horizon CDT, based at the Mixed Reality Lab, University of Nottingham.
					My PhD is all about personal data, power, and privacy, and aims to create an ethical, transparent, and reciprocal method with art galleries to collect personal data. </p>
					<p>On this site you will find more information about the study, as well as links to resources if you're interested in learning 
						more about personal data privacy, exploitation, and potential futures. <br> <b>
						Feel free to contact me with questions, comments, queries, feedback, or memes by emailing me at

						<h2>What is personal data?</h2>
						<p>Personal data is defined by the European Commission as "…any information that relates to an identified or
							identifiable living individual." This also includes "different pieces of information, which collected 
							together can lead to the identification of a particular person". This means that the term 'personal data'
							even includes information that might seem anonymised on its own, for example age, occupation, gender,
							sexuality, health status, hair colour... Even things like your fingerprints.<br />

										<h3>Personal Data</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Personal data is collected about us every single day, from dozens of different
									sources. Your social media accounts, the news sites you read, the public wifi you 
									connect to, CCTV cameras you pass, so on and so on and so on. This data can be used for 
									good, or for bad, depending on who is collecting and why. </p>

										<h3>Power</h3>
									</header>
									<p>That personal data has power. But so do you!
									Sometimes, data is used in ways that are hidden or deceptive, preventing the power 
									from being shared equally. By shedding light on these practices, it becomes possible to 
									redistribute power to make sure you have control over what happens to your data.</p>

										<h3>Why Art Galleries?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Art galleries are uniquely situated at the forefront of culture to share information
									to a huge number of people. They are able to disseminate and spread information about 
									your rights as data subjects, and to encourage healthier and more beneficial practices 
									surrounding the use of your personal data.</p>

						<h2>I want to make sure that you have the power over your own data to make informed decisions and protect yourselves</h2>
						<p> Data exploitation is an increasingly problematic source of concern and affects each and every one of us. From how much
						your mortgage costs, to the adverts you see, the recommendations suggested to you; each of these things can positively 
						affect your lives, but they can also be dangerous - particularly if you are part of a marginalised community.</p>

							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<h3>How does data exploitation affect you, and what can you do?</h3>
								<p>Data is a commodity, it’s worth something. By donating your data to organisations you pay for 
								services like social media, news, and information sites. Your data helps companies 
								understand you better, and this helps them evolve and grow and change to better
								meet demand. It makes googling something easier, your recommendations more
								accurate, it even makes your adverts relevant and useful to you.</p>

								<p> But data also has a sinister side, one that is at least as prevelant as the
								positive side. Profiling based on personal data can be used to prevent people from accessing
								specific resources. For example, 
								<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/28/tech/facebook-hud-ad-discrimination/index.html">
								it has been used to profile people searching for a new house and decide which houses they 
								can see based on factors like race, religion, sex, or disability.</a> It can also be used
								to target people based on their vulnerabilities. In 2019 
								<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/08/casino-app-ad-banned-targeting-people-googling-unsubscribe-gambling/">
								a Casumo gambling advert was banned</a> for targeting people who </p>
							
							
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<p>
								searched on Google for "how to unsubscribe from all gambling", deliberately targeting people with a gambling addiction to try to get them to play casino games. 
								There are thousands and thousands of examples of how personal data has been used to
								exploit, hurt, or discriminate against people. Airlines 
								<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/airline-travel/how-to-get-the-lowest-airfares/">
								increasing flight costs</a> for repeat searches; online quizzes 
								<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-sues-two-ukrainian-hackers-for-stealing-user-information-via-personality-quizzes/">
								harvesting data and infecting computers</a> with viruses; algorithms 
								<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">
								unearthing private information and unwittingly sharing it</a> with people's friends and 
								family; and of course
								<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election">
								the Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> interfering with political campaigning.</p>
								
								<p>However, data is a vital commodity that can be used mindfully and ethically to
								genuinely improve experiences, and one which is particularly vital for the cultural sector.
								For much of the UK's cultural sector, they rely on external funding (like the Arts Council, local councils, or sponsors)
								to survive. Those funding partners usually require the galleries to collect certain kinds of
								data to showcase how their money is being used. Data also helps organisations like galleries to understand
								their role in the world, how </p> 
 								
								
								
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<p>they are affecting their communities, and how they can continue
								to evolve to maintain relevance and make an impact. So if data collection is so widely used for 
								both good and for bad, how do you protect
								yourselves from exploitation whilst still contributing to those who will genuinely benefit from
								and protect your data? The first thing is simply to be <em>aware</em> of what data you are donating, 
								what is happening to that data, and what it's being used for. When you start to pay attention to 
								the practices in place, it quickly becomes easier to understand and make informed decisions about
								who you want to have your data, and which parts you're willing to share.</p>
									
								<p>The key is to learn, to talk to your friends and family, and to be mindful of the value of your 
								data and the power you are giving away or sharing every time you donate it. In the next section 
								I'll guide you to some resources that will offer you some starting points for this.

						<h2>So how can you learn more?</h2>
						<p>It can be pretty overwhelming at first to start to look into something like personal data collection
						and that's ok. In some cases, it might even be deliberately confusing. But there are hundreds of resources
						out there that can show you what to look for, and easy steps you can take to protect yourselves.

									<h3>A starting point</h3>
									<p>To the right of this text are links to six different resource. I've tried to include a range of different types of resources so that if 
									one of them isn't your cup of tea, a different one might still be useful! <br>
									1. The Electronic Frontier Foundation website. EFF is a not-for-profit organisation who work to
									keep people safe online. <br>
									2. A data themed YouTube video by PhilosophyTube who uses incredibly engaging formats to talk about contemporary issues.<br>
									3. A Netflix documentary about the Cambridge Analytica scandal (you will need access to a Netflix account to watch it).<br>
									4. A book by Caroline Criado-Perez that discusses and offers in depth examples of data collection (the link goes to bookseller Hive, who donate a portion of each book sold to a local bookshop
									of your choice).<br>
									5. A Cambridge University research project that
								 	will offer you an idea of what behind-the-scenes social media profiling thinks of you. Withdrawing your details from the study is also easy, should 
									you choose to do so.<br>
									6. WIRED - an online news source which covers a huge spectrum of tech related news articles.<br>
									If you have any other resources that you've really enjoyed or think should be on this list, do feel free to drop me an email and let me know!</p>
